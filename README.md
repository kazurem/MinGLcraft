# MinGLcraft

I am going pick my first opengl project to be..... minecraft. I think I am insane.. or atleast I will be after this.
Though I have made this repository... lets see if I commit to it and actually perform this insane task.
This will be a.... journey of epic proportions that will most probably take atleast a year or more. LETS START!! (only after my semester exams ofcourse. I too want to get a degree).
I will be making this in Fedora.


### 1. Setting up the compiler (gcc/g++):

I have mine already installed but if you want to do it, just use the command:

```
sudo dnf install gcc g++
```

### 2. Running the code:

To run the code, I will use the command:

```
make && make run
```
