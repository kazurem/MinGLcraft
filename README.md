# MinGLcraft

I am going pick my first opengl project to be..... minecraft. I think I am insane.. or atleast I will be after this.
Though I have made this repository... lets see if I commit to it and actually perform this insane task.
I will be making this in Fedora.

### 1. Installing  OpenGL and other libraries in Fedora:

```
sudo dnf install mesa-libGL mesa-libGL-devel freeglut freeglut-devel glew-devel glfw glfw-devel
```

### 2. Installing the compiler (gcc/g++):

I have mine already installed but if you want to do it, just use the command:

```
sudo dnf install gcc g++
```

### 3. Running the code:

To run the code, I will use the command:

```
make run
```
